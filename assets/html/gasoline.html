      <br>
        <p> I guess I knew this would happen to you </p>
        <p> Inside I did, but I refuse to know the truth </p>
        <p> I'm heading back inside to sit at home with you </p>
        <p> I think I know what's wrong </p>
        <br>
        <p> My friends put on their bravest face </p>
        <p> Their tales between their legs, something's out of place </p>
        <p> I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face </p>
        <p> Keep your mouth zipped, son </p>
        <br>
        <p> Baby, I've been there before </p>
        <p> I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone </p>
        <p> And now I'm still hanging on </p>
        <p> I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was </p>
        <br>
        <p> Tell me all important stuff </p>
        <p> What's your favorite colour? </p>
        <p> What makes you so tough? </p>
        <p> Please don't let go when you've had enough </p>
        <p> I'm on my knees </p>
